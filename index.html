			<p align="center"><img src="http://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2015/04/tarsier-4.jpg" width="400px" border="3" /></p>
			<p>Tarsiers are found only in the islands of Southeast Asia. These little primates are only 4-6 inches tall, but their hind legs are twice the length of their torso.  Additionally, their eyes are each the size of their brains.  What else makes these adorable little primates so rare?  </p>

			<p>Is it a giraffe?  Is it a zebra?  Is it a ziraffe?  A gebra?  It is an Okapi! Okapi's history reaches back to ancient Egypt, where carvings have since been found.  In Europe and Africa, prior to the 20th century, there existed legends of an "African unicorn."</p>

			<p align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Suncus_etruscus.jpg" width="400px" border="3" /></p>
			<p>The Sao Tome Shrew is on the Critically Endangered list because not only are there few left, their habitat is progressively declining.  The population continues to decrease, making these animals rare.  Found only Sao Tome Island, a small island that is actually a shield volcano that rises out of the Atlantic Ocean.  These little shrews are only about 3 inches long, and have white teeth (other than the standard yellow) and light bellies.</p>

			<p align="center"><img src="http://www.hd-wallpapersdownload.com/script/bulk-upload/images-of-a-red-wolf-wallpaper.jpg" width="400px" border="3" /></p>
			<p>The Red Wolf is a cousin to the Gray Wolf.  The Red Wolf was actually deemed extinct in the wild in 1980.  There were, luckily, some Red Wolves were still in captivity, twenty to be exact.  Wildlife conservationists increased the number of Red Wolves in captivity to 207, and today there are about 100 living in the wild.</p>

			<p align="center"><img src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Northern-Hairy-Nosed-Wombat.jpg" width="400px" border="3" /></p>
			<p>This cute critter, considered one of the rarest large mammals in the world, is on the Critically Endangered list.  Over 39 inches long, the Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat is a shade larger than normal wombats, and are able to breed faster, though that has not improved their Critically Endangered status.  </p>

			<h2 class="t2">Sheath-Tailed Bat</h2>
			<p align="center"><img src="http://www.gianmariozaino.com/img/s1/v48/p1945556074-3.jpg" height="200px" border="3" /></p>
			<p>This sac-winged bat lives in the Seychelles Islands. Once abundant throughout the island chain, the Seychelle Sheath-Tailed Bat is extinct on most of the islands.  The bats live in harem colonies, and have a high reproductive potential.  Unfortunately, they are very susceptible to habitat changes, and because of their need to roost in several different locations within a habitat, their survival has not been overly successful.</p>

			<h2 class="t2">Javan Rhino</h2>
			<p align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Panzernashorn2004.jpg" width="400px" border="3" /></p>
			<p>The Javan Rhino is one of five living rhinoceros types, and is part of the same genus as the Indian Rhinoceros, but they are smaller.  These Javan Rhinos were once abundant in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, but they are now on the Critically Endangered list with only about sixty (broken into two known populations) in the wild.  There are no Javan Rhinos in captivity. </p>

			<p>This type of rare tiger is only found in captivity.  The coloring is a result of a recessive gene, and sometimes the Golden Tabby is also called the Strawberry Tiger.  These types of tigers have a Bengal parentage, but generally have Amur tiger in their lineage somewhere.</p>

			<p>TAlso called the Chinese River Dolphin, the Whitefin Dolphin, and the Yangtze Dolphin, the Baiji is NOT the Chinese White Dolphin.  This rare animal has become "functionally extinct"  because of China's industrialization. sThere are anywhere between 0 and 13 Yangtze River Dolphins left in the world.</p>

			<p>The Pinta Island Tortoise has been reduced to one survivor â€“ George.  A Galapagos tortoise, George is considered a "poster child" for the conservation efforts in the Galapagos Islands.  George is about 100 years old, and all he's missing is a mate.  In fact, some sources report that there is a $10000 reward for someone who finds a female mate for George.</p>
